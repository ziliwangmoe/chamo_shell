Running Instruction:

Unique feature:
You can end a string with *, and the shell will search the string you input in the history list and pick out the one you have used the most before.
If you satisfy the result, you can hit Enter key to execute it, otherwise you input q and Enter to input a new command.
In the beginning, I would like to make this operation more user friendly. But I found it was very frustrating to modify the content you have inputted. So, I just simplified it. This is just a prototype of a real function.
